ENABLING COOPERATION \nAND SOLIDARITY\nEnabling spaces where people can come together to achieve common goals is key to building \nsocial cohesion. Doing so includes providing formal and institutional mechanisms for coop -\neration and solidarity as well as creating an enabling environment for bottom-up cooperation \nto elevate collective interests, interact with formal institutions, and promote change. \nSocial movements and local associations have traditionally given people – particularly people \nliving in poverty and those who belong to other excluded groups – a stronger voice and greater agency to articulate their interests. Often informal and organic, these forms of collective \naction are an essential countervailing force to the excessive concentration and use of pow -\ner. Social mobilization efforts have helped discourage people from joining violent conflicts \nand have opened space for the exercise of civic and political rights. They have challenged \nstereotypes and have played a role in building self-esteem and shared identities among, for \ninstance, workers in the informal sector – and have brought recognition to their work.

They \nstressed the importance of putting people at the centre of their decisions and joint actions \ntowards sustainable development. \nThe emphasis on a people-centred or social perspective on development can be best under -\nstood within the Summit’s historical context. The two previous decades had witnessed the \nrise of the neoliberal policy paradigm premised on the assumption that market-oriented do -\nmestic policy reforms and stringent fiscal discipline, including during downturns, would stimulate economic growth and ultimately reduce poverty. Structural adjustment programmes, \nbroadly consisting of cuts in public spending and deregulation, became preconditions for development loans.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SOCIAL COHESION\nSocial cohesion is generally defined along three key dimensions. 44 First, people in cohesive \nsocieties are willing to cooperate and show solidarity in pursuit of the common good. Second, \nthere is a shared concern for equity, fairness and inclusion. Third, cohesive societies foster a \nsense of belonging and trust among their members and in their institutions. Social cohesion \nmay grow or falter for a variety of reasons. Social and economic changes, especially struc -\ntural transformations like the industrial revolution, the rural-urban transition, or globalization, \nhave significantly impacted social cohesion in the past (Vrolijk, 2023). When the existing or -\nder shifts, societies must adjust to find a new equilibrium, usually not without friction. \nMeasuring levels and trends of social cohesion is key to assessing the impact of actions \nto promote it and track progress. However, identifying a set of common criteria applicable \nacross countries and translating them into concrete indicators is difficult.

Pervasive \ngroup-based inequalities contribute to maintaining in-group cohesion but negative feelings \ntowards other groups (Walkenhorst and Croissant, 2019).

Going beyond income and averages: subnational disparities in multi-dimensional poverty\nWhile income and consumption remain the main yardsticks to measure poverty, it is now established that poverty, in all \nits nuanced manifestations, is not merely an economic shortfall. The commitment to eradicate poverty in all its dimen -\nsions, as stated in the 2030 Agenda, reflects the recognition that people living in poverty experience many deprivations \nin their daily lives. \nAccording to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which considers overlapping deprivations in health, education \nand living standards, 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty, nearly double the number living in extreme \nincome poverty (UNDP and OPHI, 2024). The index also shows that subnational disparities in poverty are at times larger \nthan differences between countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, the percentage of the population in multi-di -\nmensional poverty ranged from 16 per cent (in Gabon) to 91 per cent (in Niger) in the mid-2010s. Within Uganda, the \npercentage of MPI poor ranged from 7 per cent in Kampala, the country’s capital and largest city, to 96 per cent in the \npoorest region, Karamoja (Alkire, Karagaratnam and Suppa, 2023).\nThe recent crises have revealed that traveling the “last mile” – eradicating poverty from t"}
