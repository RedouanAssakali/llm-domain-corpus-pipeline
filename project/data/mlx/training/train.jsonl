The ability to rapidly and \nmassively spread information enabled by these technologies can support collective action \nand mobilization.

Deeply ingrained gender biases in social norms sustain the inequalities that women \nface in public and private domains, including gender-based violence, barriers to exercising full rights, the disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic and care work, and more. \nTransmitted across generations, gendered social norms shape beliefs and attitudes that perpetuate and reinforce dis -\nparities between women and men.

Trust and conflict\nPatricia Justino, UNU-WIDER\nOutbreaks of violent conflict are the strongest signs of a breakdown of social cohesion and the social contract. Exposure \nto armed conflict has, unsurprisingly, been found to decrease both institutional and interpersonal trust. 47 In Nepal and \nUganda, for instance, the largest declines in trust occurred in the immediate aftermath of the civil war when new institutions had not yet replaced wartime organizations (De Juan and Pierskalla, 2014; De Luca and Verpoorten, 2015). Levels \nof trust in the immediate post-conflict period have, in turn, consequences for how citizens comply with their side of the \nsocial contract, how peace agreements are sustained and what state-building trajectories and civil society structures are \nadopted by new governments (Justino, 2022). Low trust in post-conflict countries may also result in renewed conflicts \nif people do not have confidence in newly formed governance institutions, and social tensions between groups remain \nunresolved. There is some evidence, however, that exposure to violence and conflict can increase pro-social behaviour, \nincluding trust in institutions and among people (Bellows and Miguel, 2009; Sacks and Larizza, 2012; Gilligan and oth -\ners, 2014; Bauer and others, 2016), but this shift is often in favour of in-group individuals, increasing parochial attitudes \n(Cassar and others, 2013). \nRegardless of the impact of violence on trust"}

This is largely because poverty is more and more en -\ntrenched in countries and regions where it is hardest to eradicate – countries with the least \nresources, institutional capacity and political stability to implement the necessary policies. \nMany of these countries are torn apart by conflict and disproportionately affected by climate \nchange, or are home to remote pockets of poverty, as illustrated in box 1. \nIndeed, extreme income poverty is increasingly concentrated in low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. 20 While middle-income countries have recovered from the pan -\ndemic, poverty-wise, low-income countries still record higher levels of poverty than in 2019. In \naddition, people living in poverty remain further below the poverty line in sub-Saharan Africa \nth"}

Then banks are able to leverage the \nresulting funds, multiplying their value for investments in low-income countries. \nSecond is the growing support of the rich donor countries for greater leveraging of their existing capital by the major \nmultilateral development banks (MDBs). That follows careful discussion with the credit rating agencies validating that \nafter three quarters of a century, the structure of the MDBs has stood the test of time, and their capital can and ought \nto be better leveraged at acceptable risk. Steps in that direction include offloading MDB portfolio risk to insurers and \ninvestors to create more MDB lending headroom with existing capital, and use of traditional donor guarantees of MDB \nloans, which also free up MDB capital. \nFinally, there has been a move by MDB member countries towards the formalization of “climate” as a twin goal of traditional development lending.

TRUST AND SOCIAL POLICY: \nOPPORTUNITIES FOR A VIRTUOUS CYCLE\nSocial policies can help build legitimacy and bolster institutional trust. People’s perception \nof how Governments address economic vulnerabilities through social spending is positively \nassociated to their trust in institutions, as shown by data from African countries (figure 12): \ntrust in public institutions is higher where people perceive that taxes are well spent and are \nsatisfied with the quality of public services and government efforts to improve the living standards of the poor. Similar results have been reported across OECD countries (OECD, 2019). \nThese findings are consistent with predictions that evaluations of government performance \nare responsive to institutional trust-building, an argument that appears particularly salient \nfor redistributive policies (Martinangeli and others, 2023; Moramarco and Palmisano, 2023). \nAt the same time, higher levels of trust in public institutions can foster compliance with tax \ncollection and regulations, and respect for property rights, hinting at the potential to enable \na virtuous cycle between the performance of public institutions and people’s trust in them \n(Citrin and Stoker, 2018). \nFigure 12. \nPercentage of \nrespondents most \ntrusting of the \nPresident and \naverage evaluation \nof"}

According to the UN Minimum Set of Gender Indicators,41 women spend an average of 4.2 daily \nhours on unpaid domestic and care work worldwide, on average, while men spend only 1.7 \nhours on such tasks. 42 The burden of unpaid care work affects women’s availability for paid \nemployment, systematically leaving women in a disadvantaged position in the labour market \n– and economically more insecure throughout the life course.

A social lens on policy: the legacy of the World Summit for Social Development\nThe 1995 World Summit for Social Development marked a turning point in the UN’s agenda on social issues. At the Summit, Governments stressed the importance of putting people at the centre of their decisions and joint actions towards \nsustainable development. In committing to direct their economies to meet human needs, Governments established that \neconomic efficiency and growth were means of improving well-being, rather than ends in themselves. They also stated \nthat economic development, social development and environmental protection were interdependent and mutually rein -\nforcing components of sustainable development (paragraph 6, Copenhagen Declaration).\nThe outcomes of the 1995 Summit, together with those of other global conferences held during the 1990s, inspired the \ninternational development agenda in the decades that followed. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s core \nmessage of inclusion and its rallying pledge to ensure that no one will be left behind echo the framing principles of the \nCopenhagen Declaration. In the Agenda, Member States committed to achieving sustainable development in its three \ndimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner. The SDGs, according to the \n2030 Agenda’s Declaration, are indivisible and balance these three dimensions.\nWhile the 1995 Copenhagen D"}

There \nhave been many setbacks but also breakthroughs. More than one billion people have escaped \nextreme poverty since 1995. People are living longer and are more educated than ever before. \nWe are also better connected thanks to rapid technological advances, including expanded \ninternet and mobile phone access. \nYet, many people believe that life is worse now than it was 50 years ago. 15 This part of the \nreport highlights two likely reasons for the pessimistic assessment shared by a large swath \nof the population, despite advances in a number of social goals. First, the benefits of progress \nhave not been shared equally. Social and economic inequalities persist and, in many cases, \nhave worsened. Second, people around the world also report that they are feeling insecure. \nAccording to the most recent Gallup World Poll evaluation on life satisfaction, 60 per cent of \nrespondents wer"}

The trend that emerges from recent research is one of growing heterogeneity in the situation of both formal and informal workers. \nResearch on labour market transitions shows, for instance, that some informal jobs can serve \nas stepping-stones to formal, more secure employment. However, a large majority of workers \nremain in informal employment for long periods – many throughout their working lives.\n\nWORLD SOCIAL REPORT 2025 A NEW POLICY CONSENSUS TO ACCELERATE SOCIAL PROGRESS\nAccording to a series of developing country studies covering periods ranging from one to 19 \nyears, depending on the study, less than a quarter of informal workers in “low tier” jobs (those \nrequiring little training and providing low earnings) had transitioned to formal employment or \nto “upper tier” informal employment at the end of the observation period in most countries.30 \nCountry studies also suggest that, while formal wage workers rarely transition to informal \njobs, the risk of downward mobility – from formal to informal employment – is significant for \nworkers in formal self-employment, particularly in low tier jobs. \nThus, the greater divide is that between waged workers in formal employment, whose risk \nof transitioning to less secure jobs is low, and the rest of the labour force.

Trust in others affects how people act collectively, \nbehave in society, cooperate with one another and engage in political and civic affairs.\nBoth types of trust are essential for collective action at local, national and global levels to -\nwards common societal goals, such as reducing the impact of climate change, addressing \npandemics, mitigating economic shocks and sustaining peace. While levels of interpersonal \ntrust often predict levels of institutional trust, one may occur at the expense of the other. \nHigh levels of interpersonal trust may compensate for low levels of institutional capacity, by \nacting as a mechanism to ensure the enforcement of contracts and reducing the likelihood \nof harmful social behaviours, in contexts where formal institutions are weak or non-existent. \nWhile maintaining and fostering trust is important and has inherent value, a certain level of \ndistrust as well as temporary fluctuations are to be expected, especially in the case of institutional trust.

Taxes and transfers reduce the Gini coefficient by 5 points (11 per cent) in Costa Rica but by less than 3 points (6 per cent) in Chile, \nfor instance. This is likely due to higher reliance on indirect taxes such as the value-added \ntax in Chile and significant higher social spending in Costa Rica (Martínez-Aguilar and others, \n2017; Sauma and Trejos, 2014). In Belgium, Finland and Ireland, direct taxes and transfers \nreduce the Gini coefficient by more than 15 points. In contrast, fiscal policy reduces the Gini \ncoefficient by less than 8 points in Japan and Switzerland. Within OECD countries, on average, \nincome taxation and direct transfer spending contributed to the reduction of the Gini coeffi -\ncient by about 25 per cent in 2015 (Causa and Hermansen, 2018). The bulk of this decline was \nattributable to the effect of transfers (Zouhar and others, 2021). \nOver time, however, the redistributive impact of taxes and transfers has failed to correct the \ntrend towards growing income inequality. In countries of the OECD, top income tax rates fell \nfrom 66 per cent in 1981 to 43 per cent in 2018 (OECD, 2019).

Whether ongoing innovations are directed to automating work – and whether the automation of tasks inevitably leads to the disappearance of jobs \n– is as much a technological question as it is an institutional one. Regulations and institutions \ninfluence the profitability of regrouping tasks into new jobs and the ability of workers to upgrade \ntheir skills to take on new responsibilities. Policies and institutions can also help encourage \nsocially beneficial innovations, as discussed in part II of this report.\n3. INEQUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE\nA growing body of evidence indicates that climate change has exacerbated inequality be -\ntween countries and is slowing down the pace of poverty reduction (United Nations, 2020a). \nA widely cited pre-pandemic study estimates that, by the late 2010s, the ratio between the \nincome of the richest and poorest 10 per cent of the global population was 25 per cent larger \nthan it would have been in a world without global warming (Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019). \nClimate change is also having an impact on intergenerational equity. The increasing disruptions \ncaused by climate change are likely to reduce the livelihood opportunities of future generations, \nespecially in countries hardest hit, and exacerbate downward intergenerational mobility. Re -\ngarding labour productivity, for instance, it is estimated that by 2030, 2.2 per cent of total working hours will be lost due to extreme heat – a productivity loss equivalent to 80 million full-time \njobs (ILO, 2019a).

Widespread informality is considered a cause of low productivity and other development deficits, with effects on economic growth and tax revenues and, \nthus, fiscal space (Ohnsorge and Yu, 20"}

Most \npolicy challenges cannot be solved this way – especially if they entail reforms altering interactions between people, such \nas improving classroom learning or curative care.
